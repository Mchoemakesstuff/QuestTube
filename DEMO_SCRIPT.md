# QuestTube Demo Script (60 seconds)

**[0:00-0:10] The Problem**
"I watch hours of educational YouTube. Lex Fridman, Andrej Karpathy, 3Blue1Brown. I finish a 2-hour podcast, feel smart for 15 minutes, then can't explain a single concept the next day. Sound familiar?"

**[0:10-0:20] The Fix**
"QuestTube turns any YouTube video into an RPG-style quiz. Watch a video, click the Quest button, pick your difficulty, and test yourself on what you just learned."

**[0:20-0:35] Demo Flow (Screen Recording)**
- Show YouTube video playing
- Click "Quest Available!" button in player controls
- Mode select screen appears (Slime Meadow / Dungeon Crawl / Boss Arena)
- Pick Dungeon Crawl (medium difficulty)
- Answer 2-3 questions quickly:
  - Show correct answer → hearts pop, XP floats up, combo builds
  - Show wrong answer → broken heart, combo breaks
- Hit Submit

**[0:35-0:50] Results Screen**
- Victory report appears: "Rank B / 75% / +75 XP / +10 Coins / Level Up!"
- Show wrong answers with timestamps → "Click to jump back to that moment in the video"
- "Wrong answers get scheduled for spaced review — the extension pings you days later to reinforce what you missed"

**[0:50-1:00] The Why**
"The science is clear: retrieval practice beats re-reading by a mile. I built QuestTube to make it as frictionless as hitting 'play next.' Turn passive consumption into active learning. Link in bio."

## Voiceover Tips

- Keep energy high but natural (not salesy)
- Pause after "Sound familiar?" (let it land)
- Speed up slightly during demo flow (0:20-0:35)
- Emphasize "retrieval practice" (0:50) — that's the hook for edu-tech people
